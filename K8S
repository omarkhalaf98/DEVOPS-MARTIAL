	1. What is kubernetes:
		a. It’s a tool that helps use to managing containers.
		b. Kubernetes provides tools and functionality around orchestrating container workloads.
		c. Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.
	2. Features of K8S:
		a. Container Orchestration:
		b. Application reliability 
		c. Automation
	3. Control Plane:
		a. Its what runs our K8S cluster globally ,  it can run on machine  in the cluster but usually run on dedicated controller machine.
		b. Type of Control Plane:
			i. Kupe-api-server: the primary interface to the control plane and the cluster itself.
			ii. ETCD: the backend data store for K8S cluster.
			iii. Kube -scheduler: the process of selecting an available node in the cluster on which the container should run.
			iv. Kupe-controller manger: runs a collection of multiple controller utilities in single process.
			v. Cloud controller manger: provide interface between K8S and other cloud platform.
	4. K8S Nodes:
		a. The machines where the containers managed by the cluster.
		b. Nodes components:
			i. Kubelet: it’s the K8s agent that runs on each individual node.
				1) It communicate with control and ensure that containers are run on its node.
				2) It handles the process of reporting container status to control plane.
			ii. Container runtime: its not part of K8S, it’s a separate software that actually runs the container on the machine (docker , containerd).
			iii. Kube proxy: it suns on each node providing network between container and services in the cluster.
	5. Kubeadm: It’s a tool that simplify the process of setting our K8S cluster.
	6. Building a K8S cluster with kubeadm: foe example we have 3 servers (1 control plane and 2 worker nodes)                  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
		a. Install all the packages on the 3 servers (containerd and all K8S packages)
		b. Initialize the cluster on the control plane server.
		c. Install the calico network add-on in control plane.
		d. Join the worker nodes to the cluster 
	7. Name space:
		a. Mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. 
		b. Virtual cluster backed with the same physical cluster, it’s a way to separate and organize the objects in the cluster.
		c. Listing exiting name spaces is done by kubectl get namespaces
		d. All cluster have a default namespace unless I assigned a name for it (kubectl get pod --namespace the_name_of_it)
		e. Create a new namespaces: kubectl create namespace the_name
